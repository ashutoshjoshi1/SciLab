-9.8.2.0 -> Not compatible with newer (EVO) spectrometers.
-Either v1.14.0.0 and v1.14.0.9 have the same problem when recovering one of the two spectrometers of a 2S system,
 when one of the spectrometers loses its power. When this happens, all dll functions will fail for that
 specific spectrometer, even though re-initializing it. The unique way to make it work again is calling AVS_Done(),
 in order to finalize the current DLL session, and then re-connect. But this AVS_Done() call is affecting to all other
 spectrometers previously connected, which could be measuring at that moment without problems. So it is needed to wait
 until all specs are not measuring, disconnect, call AVS_Done() and then reconnect all of them again.
